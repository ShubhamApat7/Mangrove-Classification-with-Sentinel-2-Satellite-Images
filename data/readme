The dataset consists of manually labeled geometry points for Mangrove and Non-Mangrove regions across various coastal zones in India, including:

Sundarban Forest (West Bengal)

Gulf of Khambhat (Gujarat)

Pichavaram Mangroves (Tamil Nadu)

Andaman & Nicobar Islands

Chorao Island (Goa)

Gulf of Kutch (Gujarat)

Mangrove Points: Marked based on known plantations and verified through satellite image inspection.

Non-Mangrove Points: Include water bodies, barren lands, forests, and vegetative regions adjacent to mangrove zones.

All points were identified using satellite imagery analysis across NDVI, NDWI, and CMIR bands to confirm vegetation type and water proximity.
